<center><p style="font-family:Arial Rounded MT;color:Crimson">
SK Children Foundation is a non profit organization(NGO). <strong> Our organization works 365 days in a year</strong> 
We teach and provide best education to those who cannot afford it.
<em> Our aim is to provide education to those who will be the future of our COUNTRY</em>. We do not discriminate on the basis of cast, gender, etc.
<strong> OUR MISSION</strong> is to bring smile on every little face by educating them ,teaching him/her good values.
Everyone deserves education. By teaching these poor children we want to end poverty. We want to see every child of Our Country to achieve good education and for this 
we are working on it.
In our country education is not available free of cost. Poor people cannot afford to pay high tuition fees in private schools. The sad part is the lack of quality in 
government schools. There is a lack of proper infrastructure, punctuality and motivation among the teachers. So the number of dropouts from such schools keeps increasing and 
the children end up working as labourers and remain in poverty for the rest of their lives.
We want to drag them out from the darkness to the path of light full of education, better future and most importantly good and a happy life.

<h2 align="center" style="color:orange;font-size:250%;font-family:Times New Roman; line-height:0.1">How It All Started </h2>
<img src="raghav.jpeg" alt="Raghav Sharma" height="200px", width="200px" align="left">
<p style="font-family:Arial Rounded MT;color:OrangeRed	">In 2016, Raghav Sharma (Founder Of SKCF), a class 12<sup> th</sup> student, was buying Ice Cream. He saw group of children 
who came near him and requested him to buy ice-cream for them. Raghav asked them if they will recite English Alphabets, then he will buy them a treat.When they failed in reciting the alphabets
, he realised that still living in 21<sup>st</sup> Century, Education is not available to all.
He believed that he must be the change he wants to see in the society. Hence, he took immediate action and started teaching a couple of kids around the neighbourhood in 
a nearby park in Janakpuri. He hasn’t looked back ever since. The number of kids have grown from one to 150+, new dedicated members have joined the cause, volunteers have 
helped on many occasions and numerous events have already been held.
In 2019, the NGO was formally registered as SK Children Foundation as a public charitable trust. Contact us on the mentioned email or instagram and facebook pages to connect with us.
All the pictures and logs of our activities can be checked on our Instagram and Facebook pages: skchildrenfoundation.
